## Project Description

**TutorialsNinjaAutomation** is a comprehensive automation testing project designed to test the functionality of the **Tutorials Ninja** demo website. The project simulates common user actions, such as adding products to the cart, checking out, and verifying product details. The goal of this project is to showcase modern automation techniques for testing web applications in real-world scenarios.

### Main Goal
The main goal is to demonstrate automated testing capabilities using **Selenium** and **Pytest**, ensuring the reliability and functionality of the website while saving time and improving test coverage.

## Key Features

- **Automated Browsing**: Automates the browsing of various sections of the website such as product search and checkout processes.
- **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)**: Runs tests multiple times with different data sets to validate various scenarios.
- **Mouse Actions**: Simulates mouse events such as hover, click, and drag-and-drop.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verifies the website's functionality across different browsers.
- **File Handling**: Reads and writes data from CSV and JSON files for flexible test execution.
- **Allure Reporting**: Generates detailed and interactive test reports for test results visualization.
