## Project Description

**TutorialsNinjaAutomation** is a comprehensive automation testing project designed to test the functionality of the **Tutorials Ninja** demo website. It simulates common user actions, such as adding products to the cart, checking out, and verifying product details. The primary aim of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of modern automation tools and frameworks in real-world web applications.

**Main Goal**: To showcase the power of automated testing by validating website behavior, ensuring the functionality of various features, and maintaining quality through repetitive and efficient tests.

The automation framework covers cross-browser testing, data-driven testing, and element interaction using **Selenium** and **Pytest**.

## Key Features

- **Automated Browsing**: Automates browsing through various sections of the website, including product search and checkout processes.
- **Data-Driven Testing (DDT)**: Runs tests with various data sets for efficient validation of multiple input scenarios.
- **Mouse Actions**: Simulates mouse interactions such as hover, click, and drag on page elements.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensures compatibility and functionality across different browsers.
- **File Handling**: Reads and writes data from CSV and JSON files, enhancing testing flexibility.
- **Allure Reporting**: Generates detailed and interactive test reports.

## Installation

### System Requirements:
- **Python version**: 3.11 or higher
- **Libraries**:
  - Selenium
  - Pytest
  - Pandas
  - Allure Report
  - WebDriver Manager
